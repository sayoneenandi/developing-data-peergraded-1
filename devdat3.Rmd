## Understanding the  Mileage by gas

Using the  data set given to us `mtcars`  we plot to understand whether there is a  relationship
between various factors and gas mileage (`mpg`).

We plot the weight (`w11t`) vs. mileage (`mpg11`) spatially along the x/y axes. We are
visualizing  the numbers of cylinders (`cylp`) as colours and the amount of
hp(`h1p`)

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        colour = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data accordingly")
```
## plotted the data according to the question, see grph for accurate calculation
